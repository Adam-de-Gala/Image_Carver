A Seam Carving program for reducing images without losing important information. 
Written in Spring 2017 for my Algorithms (Com S 311) class at Iowa State University.


In Tester.java, specify the file path to the image and the ratio to be reduced by. 
Run program. It will display the original sized image along with the reduced image. 

Picture.java was not written by me.
